# Data Science Internship Projects

This repository contains the projects I completed during my one-month data science internship with Let's Grow More. The projects showcase my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and neural networks.

## Projects

### 1. Iris Flower Classification
A classic machine learning project focused on classifying iris flowers into three species based on their features.

- **Tools & Technologies:** Python, scikit-learn
- **Dataset:** Iris dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Techniques:** Data preprocessing, model training (K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest), model evaluation

#### Highlights:
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset
- Implemented various classification algorithms
- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, and recall

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis on Terrorism
An in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of global terrorism data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights.

- **Tools & Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Dataset:** Global Terrorism Database (GTD)
- **Techniques:** Data cleaning, visualization, trend analysis

#### Highlights:
- Cleaned and preprocessed a large dataset
- Visualized trends in terrorist activities over time and across regions
- Identified key patterns and insights from the data

### 3. Neural Network for Handwriting Recognition
Developed a neural network capable of recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

- **Tools & Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Dataset:** MNIST dataset
- **Techniques:** Data normalization, neural network architecture design, model training and evaluation

#### Highlights:
- Designed and implemented a neural network model
- Trained the model on the MNIST dataset
- Achieved high accuracy in handwriting recognition
